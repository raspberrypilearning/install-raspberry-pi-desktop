Running the Raspberry Pi Desktop is a great way to recycle old hardware that's no longer capable of running the latest version of Windows or macOS.

It also comes pre-installed with lots of software tools to get you started with coding and digital making.

**Warning:** installing Raspberry Pi Desktop on a computer will delete all the data on it. Be sure to back up anything you need before you go any further.
