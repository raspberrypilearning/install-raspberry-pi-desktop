## Download Raspberry Pi Desktop

+ Go to the [Raspberry Pi Desktop website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/), and start the download of the latest installation file by clicking on the **Download ISO** button. 

**Note:** the download may take a long time because the file is large. We therefore recommend that using a high-speed internet connection.
